What kind of data does the heightmap image data hold? What range is the heightmap data?
- The height of the terrain, stored in the range 0-255

The terrain is 4x4. How many polygons does it draw?
- 18 triangles are used

Did you need to extend your camera movement code? How?
- I didn't have to change anything in my camera movement code, it already had enough controls

How did you implement the cross product? Function call, inline...? Normalization?
- I called the CrossProduct from VectorUtils and normalized it afterwards

Which method did you use to find the normal vector?
- I took 3 neighbouring vertices, constructed two vectors representing the plane of the face, then the cross product yields the orthogonal vector i.e the normal

How did you figure out what surface to use?
- By performing subtraction between the real (float) position and the rounded (int) position, and checking if the sum dx and dz is < 1 or not

How did you calculate the height from the surface?
- By interpolating the height over the selected triangle surface

What kind of multitexturing function did you implement?
- I made the texture depend on the height of the interpolated vertex, blending them togheter making a smooth transition

How did you move the camera? What distance did you use over the terrain?
- I set the camera height to be +5 units above the terrain
