Answers:

Where is the origin placed in the on-screen coordinate system?
- The origin is placed at [0, 0]

Which direction are the X and Y axes pointing in the on-screen coordinate system?
- X axis: [1, 0] Y axis: [0, 1]

The triangle color is controlled from the fragment shader. Would it be possible to control it from the main program? How?
- Yes, you can use a uniform float4 variable. It's value will be the save for all vertices.

What is the purpose of the "in", "out" and "uniform" modifiers?
- uniform - global modifier
	in/out - the input and output variables for the shader

What is the output of the vertex shader?
- The position of the vertex being processed (input to fragment shader)

What does the function glUniformMatrix4fv do?
- Sets the value of a uniform in a shader program with the type "4x4 float matrix"

What is the frame rate of the animation?
- 50 FPS

Did you need to do anything different when uploading the color data?
- No the process was the same

The "in" and "out" modifiers are now used for something different. What?
- They are used to pass variables between the vertex shader and the fragment shader. An "out" variable from the vertex shader is a "in" variable in the fragment shader

What is this kind of shading called? What could we use otherwise?
- It's a simple shader that uses interpolation between the vertices to get each pixels unique color. A pixel shader

What problems did you encounter while building the cube?
- Keeping track of all the vertices was hard

How do you change the facing of a polygon?
- It depends on if you construct the polygon in a clockwise or counterclockwise manner. You can change the default (counterclockwise) with glFrontFace()

Why do we need normal vectors for a model?
- The normal vectors tells which direction a face is pointing, it is often used to perform lighting calculations

What did you do in your fragment shader?
- Nothing, the color passed to the fragment shader is the normal of the triangle and is used as the color 

Should a normal vector always be perpendicular to a certain triangle? If not, why?
- Yes

Now we are using glBindBuffer and glBufferData again. They deal with buffers, but in what way?
- glBindBuffer() binds a buffer to perform operations on. glBufferData() creates and stores data for the currently bound 
	buffer (specified with the latest glBindBuffer())
